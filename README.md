## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

This challenge didn't have any changes with different screen sizes, but I'd make sure that I'm going to practice more about media query as I'm still having a hard time with responsive website. 

### Useful resources
